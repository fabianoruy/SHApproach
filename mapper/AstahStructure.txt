Your astah file must follow the structure presented in the figure.
Regardless of other packages, this tool will read the packages named "Initiative" and "Standards Structural Models".
* Standards Structural Models package: must have a subpackage for each Standard, each one with a single diagram and the related concepts.
* Initiative package: must have a single subpackage for your initiative (e.g. Quality Assurance) and 3 subpackages:
  - "1.SEON View": with a single diagram representing this view, and the selected portion of SEON (in subpackages).
  - "2.Structure": with a diagram for each Standard and one for the Integrated Structural Model (ISM). The ISM aditional elements stay here.
  - "3.Content"  : with a package for each selected Standard (each containing the Standard elements and a single diagram); and the resulting diagram "Integrated Content Model" with the added new elements.
Allways try to avoid not used classes and relations.  

Phases:
1) Initiative Information				Get main information; Show phases (menu)
2) Model Reading						Parse Astah
3) Structural Mappings and ISM (done)	Just show
4) Vertical Mappings (Std*1)			Create the matches (vertical)
5) ICM Elements Creation / Changing		Create the new/modified elements
6) Horizontal Mappings (Std*(Std-1))	Create the matches (derived/horizontal)
7) Harmonization Results				Show results (main table, ICM modifications)


# Match validation
* Match
  - inputs ok?
    - no: stop
    - yes: concept repeated?
      - no: finish
      - not allowed: stop
      - no problem: finish
      - composite match: call again

The element A has now 3 matches:
A [I] O1
A [W] O2
A [W] O3
Do these matches together fully cover the element?
( ) Yes, the element is EQUIVALENT to the sun of the concepts.
( ) Yes, the element is PART OF the sun of the concepts.
( ) No, the element remains not fully covered.
		[OK]
